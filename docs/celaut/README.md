# Celaut light client: design notes

These notes are the reference for the Celaut part of chatui. The app is an Android
light client of Celaut. It talks to Celaut nodes (celaut-project/nodo) as a client,
never as a peer, and it pays them from its own Ergo wallet.

Sources read for these notes:

- celaut-project/nodo at `b5c1e8a5` (paths below start with `nodo:`).
- bee-rpc-over-grpc-py v0.0.1/v0.0.2 (`bee_rpc:`).
- celaut-project/skills at its `main` branch of 2026-10-11 (`skills:`).

| [package.md](package.md) | Give a service to a node that does not have it: from a node that has it, or from a `.celaut.bee` file, with cancel markers so that a node never keeps half a service |
| [env-variables.md](env-variables.md) | Environment variables: a container in the app, and one question per variable at a launch (choose, type or skip) |
| [invite.md](invite.md) | The peer invitation of nodo in a QR code: what the app reads, the binary scanner, and how it chooses the address that can work on the route |
| [service-info.md](service-info.md) | The details of a service, read from its Service as a stream that skips the filesystem, and the check of the chat interface before a launch |
