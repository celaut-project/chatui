# Licence

chatui is free software under the **GNU General Public License, version 3 only**
(`GPL-3.0-only`). The full text is in `LICENSE`.

The reason is `bee-rpc` (https://github.com/bee-rpc-protocol/bee-rpc-over-grpc-rs),
which the app links into `libwallet_ffi.so` and which is `GPL-3.0-only`. A program that
links it has to be offered under the GPL.

## Argus (MIT)

chatui is a fork of the Argus Ergo wallet (https://github.com/arkadianet/Argus), with
its history kept. Argus declares the MIT licence (`license = "MIT"` in its Cargo
manifest, authors "arkadianet"). The code that comes from Argus stays available under
the MIT terms below. The MIT licence is compatible with the GPL, and the combined work
is distributed under the GPL.

The upstream repository has no `LICENSE` file, so there is no copyright line to copy.
The notice above is the MIT text that applies to the Argus code, from its authors
(arkadianet and the contributors of Argus).
