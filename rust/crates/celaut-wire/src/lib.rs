//! Transport of the Celaut Gateway for a client.
//!
//! - [`identity`]: reads the identity extension of a node certificate
//!   (`docs/celaut/wire.md`, section 1) and checks it. The check is a rustls
//!   `ServerCertVerifier`.
//! - [`channel`]: a TCP and TLS 1.3 connection that uses that verifier, and the tonic
//!   channel on it. It gives the `peer_id` of the node.
//! - [`transport`]: the [`Transport`] trait. One method sends bee-rpc parts to one
//!   Gateway method and returns the parts of the answer. A test can replace it.
//! - [`gateway`]: the typed calls of milestones M1 to M3.
//! - [`relay`]: the call that gives a service to a node, and stops when the node
//!   answers before the end (it already has the service).
//! - [`tunnel`]: `ServiceTunnel`, a byte stream to one port of an instance.
//!
//! Input from a peer must never make this crate panic.
