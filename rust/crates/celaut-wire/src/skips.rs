//! The blocks that a node says it holds, for a call that gives it a service.
//!
//! A node that receives a block that it already has can ask the sender to stop it: it
//! sends a Buffer with `skip` and an empty chunk, in the answer direction (bee-rpc,
//! `bee_rpc::skip`). nodo does it on the input of `StartService` and
//! `GetServiceEstimatedCost` (`nodo:src/gateway/iterables/abstract_input_service_iterable.py`,
//! nodo#584). A node that does not, never sends one, and the service goes whole.
//!
//! [`Skips`] is shared by the two sides of a call. [`Skips::wrap`] sits on the stream of the
//! service and drops the body of the blocks that the node asked to skip, but not their end
//! markers. [`crate::relay::call_with_service`] reads the skip requests of the answer into it.
//! Wrap a [`crate::SendCounter`] around the result, not under it, to count what goes.
