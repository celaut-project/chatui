//! `ServiceTunnel`: a byte stream to one port of an instance, through the node.
//!
//! The request is `TokenMessage{token, slot, receipts}` at index 1, then each payload at
//! index 0. The answer is the bytes of the service at index 0 (`docs/celaut/wire.md`,
//! section 5), and the signed checkpoints of the execution receipt at index 2
//! (nodo#419). The end of the request (a half-close) closes the write side of the TCP
//! connection from the node to the service.
//!
//! The node charges the instance `TUNNEL_OPEN_MU` for each stream, and then for the
//! traffic. One stream carries one TCP connection.
//!
//! # Receipts
//!
//! The client always asks for receipts (`TokenMessage.receipts`), and it accepts index 2
//! also when it did not ask: a node can send receipts to every caller. Each message
//! that this side sends at index 0 is one event of the `in` chain, and each message
//! that it gets at index 0 is one event of the `out` chain ([`crate::receipt`]). The
//! client keeps both chains, and checks each checkpoint against them: the node must
//! sign the bytes that this side sent and got. The result goes to a [`ReceiptSink`].
//! A stream that this side cancels gets no `close`, and that is not a fault.
